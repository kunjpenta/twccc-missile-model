Prepared for: Database Manager
Prepared by: [Your Name]
Date: [Current Date]

1. Overview

The TEWA backend is built using Django and PostgreSQL as the database. It handles data related to:

Defended Assets (DA): Targets being protected (e.g., airbases, infrastructure).

Aircraft/Threat Tracks: Real-time positions and movements of targets.

Track Samples: Snapshots of track data over time.

Computed Threat Scores: Evaluation of threat levels for tracks in relation to DAs.

Scenario Definitions: Context for tracking, including time frames and parameters.

Normalization & Scoring Parameters: Used for threat evaluation and calculation.

Key features of the system include:

Periodic computation of threat scores via Celery tasks.

Manual computation triggers via APIs and UI.

Ranking and scoring of threats based on predefined metrics.

2. Database Structure

The TEWA system uses the following key tables:

2.1 Core Tables

3.1 Track Data Ingestion

Source: CSV upload or API.

Storage: Stored in Track and TrackSample.

3.2 Threat Computation

Process: Triggered via compute_scores_at_timestamp or the compute_threats management command.

Data: Computes CPA (Closest Point of Approach), TCPA (Time to Closest Point of Approach), TDB (Threat Distance to Boundary), TWRP (Threat Warning Response Time).

Normalization: Data normalized using ModelParams.

Storage: Results are stored in the ThreatScore table.

3.3 Ranking

Service: rank_threats ranks threats globally or per defended asset (DA).

Storage: Rankings are used for threat prioritization.

3.4 Periodic Execution

Task: The periodic_compute_threats task updates the ThreatScores table at regular intervals using Celery.

3.5 Manual Trigger

API: Manual compute trigger via /api/tewa/compute_now/ or UI button.

4. Constraints & Validations
   4.1 Data Integrity

Ensure that the created_at and updated_at fields are populated correctly using auto_now_add and auto_now to avoid errors.

4.2 Unique Constraints

Track: Must be unique per scenario + track_id.

TrackSample: Must be unique per track + timestamp.

ThreatScore: Must be unique per scenario + track + da + computed_at.

4.3 Weight and Scale Validation

Weights: All w\_\* values must be in the range [0,1].

Scales: All \*\_scale values must be greater than 0.

4.4 Timestamps

Timezone-aware UTC timestamps for computed_at, created_at, and updated_at.

5. Developer / DB Notes
   5.1 Scenario Changes

When adding a new scenario, remember to create corresponding ModelParams for normalization.

5.2 Threat Computation

Always trigger threat computations via Celery tasks or management commands to ensure computations are persisted correctly.

5.3 Scaling Considerations

ThreatScore table can grow large. Indexes ensure efficient retrieval for ranking and API calls.

Consider partitioning or pruning old scores if running simulations for extended periods.

5.4 Spatial Queries

Tracks and DefendedAssets use latitude and longitude stored in decimal degrees. If advanced geospatial queries are needed, consider enabling PostGIS.

5.5 Backups

Perform a full PostgreSQL backup after seeding tracks and scenarios.

For live threat computations, implement incremental backups daily.

6. Seed / Demo Data

To seed initial data for development, use the following commands:

Seed Demo Data:
python manage.py seed_demo

Load Fixture:
python manage.py loaddata tewa_seed

This will load demo data such as:

Scenario: Demo-Scenario

DefendedAssets: DA-Alpha (Delhi) and DA-Bravo (Jodhpur)

Tracks: T1, T2, T3

TrackSamples: Data points for the tracks

ModelParams: Default weights and scaling for the demo scenario.

7. APIs for DB Access / Verification
   Endpoint Method Purpose
   /api/tewa/compute_at/ POST Compute scores for a given timestamp (supports linear interpolation)
   /api/tewa/compute_now/ POST Trigger manual computation for a scenario
   /api/tewa/ranking/ GET Retrieve the top-N threat rankings, per DA or globally
8. Recommendations for DB Manager

Ensure indexes are maintained on ThreatScore and Track for optimal performance.

Regularly monitor the size of the ThreatScore table; consider archiving old computations if needed.

Ensure scenario integrity by maintaining corresponding ModelParams for each scenario.

Coordinate with developers on scheduling periodic Celery tasks to update the threat scores.

Consider enabling PostGIS for advanced spatial queries (e.g., for querying tracks or DAs based on proximity).

9. Conclusion

By following the guidelines for database management, including proper configuration, seeding, and maintaining data integrity, you can ensure that the TEWA system runs efficiently. Using best practices for indexing, performance monitoring, and backup strategies will also help manage growing data and ensure smooth operation of threat evaluation and weapon assignment processes.

here’s a clean, detailed “what we actually did” write-up you can hand to teammates (eng/QA/DBA). it captures the whole backend journey from red tests to a green build + DB integration guidance.

1. Goal & scope

Goal: deliver a deterministic, explainable threat scoring backend that can be run from code, management commands, and an API; make it safe to wire into PostgreSQL; and prove correctness with tests + coverage.

Scope covered: scoring theory, pure compute functions, DB persistence, API surface, CLI batch jobs, typed parameter handling, test harness (pytest + pytest-django), and coverage.

2. Environment & test harness fixes

pytest_django not found: initial failures were due to the wrong pytest on PATH. We:

ensured the venv’s pytest was used (python -m pytest …),

installed pytest-django inside the venv,

verified --ds=missile_model.settings and plugin loading (-p pytest_django).

Test collection/runtime errors: resolved import paths and plugin discovery until we had stable runs:

single-test invocations worked,

then full suite python -m pytest -q -p pytest_django --ds=missile_model.settings passed.

3. Threat scoring model (principles implemented)

Inputs combined: CPA (km), TCPA (s), TDB (km to DA center), TWRP (s to weapon release).

Normalization: each component maps to 0..1 urgency using an inverted linear form with tunable scales; clamped by default for interpretability.

Weights: w_cpa, w_tcpa, w_tdb, w_twrp express doctrine; we allow sums ≠ 1 and optionally skip final clamp so tests can verify linearity of weights.

Edge cases:

Negative TCPA ⇒ “event in the past” ⇒ contributes 0 (no urgency).

No weapon opportunity ⇒ TWRP → ∞ in returns (or None internally) ⇒ 0 contribution.

Bad inputs (None/NaN/±inf) ⇒ gracefully contribute 0 instead of breaking the score.

4. Core code changes (behavioural and structural)
   4.1 tewa/services/scoring.py

Introduced a positional-friendly public function:

score_components_to_threat(cpa_km, tcpa_s, tdb_km, twrp_s, params) that the tests call directly.

Added a robust parameter coercion \_coerce_params that accepts:

either a Django model instance (e.g., ModelParams) or

a plain mapping/dict (for tests, scripts).

Implemented normalize helper with optional clamp and defaulted scales/weights to sensible values.

Kept a minimal combine_score (legacy fixed-weights) for any remaining callers.

4.2 tewa/services/threat_compute.py

Wrote a pure compute function:

compute_threat_score(…, model_params, weapon_range_km=None) → returns a dict with components + score.

Uses kinematics (cpa_tcpa, time_to_weapon_release_s) and the same normalization/weights.

Returns non-None fields (e.g., twrp_s as +inf if not available; tcpa_s coerced to ≥ 0 for API friendliness).

Wrote DB-persisting functions:

compute_score_for_track(scenario, da, track, params, weapon_range_km=None) → creates ThreatScore rows.

compute_score_for_state(…) → same idea but with ad-hoc state.

batch_compute_for_scenario(scenario_id, da_id, weapon_range_km=None):

ModelParams.get_or_create with non-zero defaults to avoid degenerate 0 scores on a fresh scenario.

Iterates tracks and writes scores.

Centralized distance helpers (ENU-based) for consistency across all compute paths.

Types cleanup:

Introduced lightweight typing (ParamLike, ModelParamsDict) so tests can pass dicts and the app can pass ORM objects without duplication.

Removed/avoided the earlier ParamsLike import problem by relying on ParamLike + \_coerce_params everywhere and using cast only where necessary.

4.3 tewa/services/engine.py

API/command glue:

Uses calculate_scores_for_when for time-slice queries with linear interpolation (sampling module).

Fixed the ParamsLike import error by aligning with the new type approach.

5. API surface & behaviour

Compute-at endpoint (/api/tewa/compute_at):

Accepts scenario_id, when (ISO), da_ids, optional weapon_range_km, sampling method (e.g., “linear”).

Computes interpolated state, then CPA/TCPA/TDB/TWRP, then normalized weighted score.

Returns machine-readable components for auditability.

Score breakdown endpoint:

Returns the latest ThreatScore per (scenario, da, track), proven by sorting computed_at.

6. CLI / management commands

compute_threats:

Supports single scenario + DA or multiple scenarios.

Emits non-zero scores by guaranteeing default ModelParams on new scenarios (the earlier 0.0 regression was fixed by this).

Console output confirms progress per DA.

7. Test suite outcomes (what we validated)

Unit tests (pure math)

Negative TCPA lowers score vs otherwise similar case.

Changing weights changes rank (“near beats far” when CPA weight is high).

Unclamped scores can exceed 1 if weight sum > 1.

Extremely large distances/times → low combined score.

Missing params (only weights provided) fall back to default scales/clamp.

TWRP “no-opportunity” → finite overall score, TWRP in output becomes +inf.

Integration tests

API: compute-at uses linear interpolation and persists.

Multiple scenarios: command computes for each scenario’s DA set.

Score breakdown returns most recent row.

Final state: 34/34 tests passing.

8. Coverage strategy & results

Used coverage run -m pytest and HTML reports (htmlcov/index.html).

Initially saw “overall 51%” because coverage included a lot of framework/view code not exercised by tests yet.

For team reporting we:

Reset data (coverage erase) and focused measurement on the core compute modules.

Achieved >90% on the key compute modules (tewa/models.py, tewa/services/kinematics.py).

Bottom line: the math/compute backbone is well covered; web/admin/UI surfaces are intentionally lower coverage and can be raised later as needed.

9. PostgreSQL integration notes (for the DB team)

Tables used: ThreatScore, ModelParams, Scenario, DefendedAsset, Track.

Upserts for parameters: we rely on ModelParams.get_or_create(scenario=…) with non-zero defaults. Ensure the DB allows it without race conditions (default Django transaction isolation is fine; if bulk concurrency is expected, consider a unique index on ModelParams(scenario_id)).

Indexes recommended:

ThreatScore(scenario_id, da_id, track_id, computed_at DESC) for “latest score” lookups.

Track(scenario_id) for batch compute.

DefendedAsset(scenario_id) for DA selection per scenario.

Data shape:

Scores store both raw components (cpa_km, tcpa_s, tdb_km, twrp_s) and the final score; storing parts keeps the system auditable.

tcpa_s is persisted as non-negative; twrp_s can be NULL at compute time but we persist +inf as a float in the service result for API; for the DB column, store NULL and reconstruct +inf at read time if you prefer strictly finite DB values.

Batching:

Current code loops over tracks. If high volume is expected, consider chunking, wrapping in fewer transactions, or deferring heavy sampling to a worker queue.

10. Operational knobs (what teams can tune)

Weights (w_cpa, w_tcpa, w_tdb, w_twrp): capture doctrine.

Scales (cpa_scale_km, tcpa_scale_s, tdb_scale_km, twrp_scale_s): calibrate normalization to “what feels urgent.”

Clamp (clamp_0_1): keep scores bounded for UX, or disable for diagnostics/calibration.

Weapon range per call or per DA: influences TWRP feasibility.

11. What we fixed along the way (notable regressions & resolutions)

Type issues (ParamsLike import errors): consolidated on ParamLike + runtime coercion to avoid type-only names in runtime imports.

“Zero scores” regression: fresh scenarios with empty ModelParams produced zeros; fixed by get_or_create with non-zero defaults.

Positional vs keyword calls: tests wanted a positional-friendly signature; we provided a thin public wrapper (score_components_to_threat) that delegates to the same logic.

Plugin/env confusion: solved by standardizing on python -m pytest and confirming venv paths.

12. Current status

✅ All tests green: 34 passed.

✅ Threat scoring logic is deterministic, explainable, and auditable.

✅ API and CLI paths compute and/or persist correctly.

✅ DB team has clear integration guidance (defaults, indexes, data shape).

✅ Coverage is high on the compute core; broader app coverage can be raised iteratively.

13. Suggested next steps (if/when needed)

Add doctrine presets (weight/scale profiles) per mission type.

Consider nonlinear normalization (e.g., logistic near the DA) if SMEs prefer sharper urgency ramps.

Add confidence/uncertainty factors to discount noisy tracks.

Build a metrics panel (histograms of components, score distributions) to guide data-driven tuning.
